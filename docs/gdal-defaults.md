# Default GDAL Config

Many of GDAL's default configuration settings are designed for local access patterns and perform poorly for data in cloud object storage. [Titiler's documentation](https://developmentseed.org/titiler/advanced/performance_tuning/#gdal-configuration) includes details on some configuration settings that you would likely want to fine-tune. [GDAL's documentation](https://gdal.org/en/stable/user/configoptions.html) includes a full description of all configuration options.
